abstract="This chapter addresses the principles involved in three key areas in satellite communications, namely, modulation (and demodulation), forward error coding, and multiple access approaches or techniques. It focuses on features and technical approaches utilized in modern-day digital satellite communications systems. Since analog approaches or techniques are today seldom used in operating satellite networks, they are not addressed in detail. Nevertheless, several references are given concerning such analog techniques should there be a historical interest in these subjects. The materials provided in this chapter are aimed at giving an appreciation of the issues involved and the performance achievable in practice. For more detailed mathematical treatments, an extensive bibliography is also provided.",

abstract="Satellite communications makes use of radiofrequency links. Particular frequencies are allocated for satellite communications through international regulatory registration and coordination processes which prevents interference between systems. In typical operation, a satellite's transponder receives an uplinked signal from Earth, changes its frequency slightly to avoid self-interference, and retransmits it on a downlink to Earth. Antennas provide gain by focusing the transmitted energy. Path loss describes a natural spreading out of the transmitted wave front as it travels through space. A link budget is an accounting of gains and losses throughout a system that is used as a design tool to provide sufficient power (or gain) to allow a satellite connection to be established. The link margin is the excess amount of received signal power above what is required. Shannon's law implies that there are trade-offs possible in a communications system design between power, bandwidth, and complexity.",

abstract="The telemetry, tracking, and control (TT{\&}C) subsystem of a satellite provides a connection between the satellite itself and the facilities on the ground. The purpose of the TT{\&}C function is to ensure the satellite performs correctly. As part of the spacecraft bus, the TT{\&}C subsystem is required for all satellites regardless of the application. This chapter describes the three major tasks that the TT{\&}C subsystem performs to ensure the successful operation of an applications satellite: (1) the monitoring of the health and status of the satellite through the collection, processing, and transmission of data from the various spacecraft subsystems, (2) the determination of the satellite's exact location through the reception, processing, and transmitting of ranging signals, and (3) the proper control of satellite through the reception, processing, and implementation of commands transmitted from the ground. Some advanced spacecraft designs have evolved toward ``autonomous operations'' so that many of the control functions have been automated and thus do not require ground intervention except under emergency conditions.",
